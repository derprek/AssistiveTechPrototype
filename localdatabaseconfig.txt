Here are the steps for setting up the local database config:
Note: I am assuming that you have setup Homestead and all the relevant 
data on your local machine. If you need to do so, come to me or Tom
and we'll assist you - Josh

1. On your local machine, ssh into the virtual box
by run ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

2. cd into the folder of the laravel project (e.g. my-first-app)

3. Connect to mysql as the homestead user by running:
mysql -uhomestead -p. You will then get a prompt saying:
Enter password:
Enter "secret" (case sensitive)

4. You should now be connected to mysql with the prompt:
mysql>
Now, enter: CREATE DATABASE atest; (with the semicolon)

5. Exit out of mysql (run exit;)

6. Go to config/database.php

7. Go to 'connections' and go to where it says 'mysql'. Change 
the 'username' and 'password' as follows:

'username' => env('DB_USERNAME', 'homestead'),
'password' => env('DB_PASSWORD', 'secret'),

8. You should be good to go now.
